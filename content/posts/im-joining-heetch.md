After several years in Switzerland, during which I worked on enhancing email security with [Revamail](https://www.letemps.ch/economie/startup-vaudoise-revapost-veut-securiser-lenvoi-demails), I have decided that it is time for me to move on to something else.

I am excited to announce that I will be joining [Heetch](https://www.heetch.com/) as their first Go engineer.

Heetch is a ride-hailing service that operates in several European cities, and I'm looking forward to being a part of their team.

My task at Heetch will be to help migrate a Ruby on Rails monolith to a fleet of microservices in Go.

This will be a challenging but exciting project that will allow me to apply my skills and experience in a new context. In addition to the technical challenges of my new role, I'm excited to be part of a team that is working to innovate and improve the way people get around in urban areas.

Thank you for reading, and please stay tuned for updates on my journey with Heetch.
