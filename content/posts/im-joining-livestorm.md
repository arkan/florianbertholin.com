After conducting several months of thorough research, I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted the position of Senior Engineering Manager of the Infrastructure team at [Livestorm](https://livestorm.co/), a leading video communication platform based in Europe.

Livestorm has recently raised [$30 million in Series B funding](https://livestorm.co/blog/livestorm-30-million-series-b).

While the infrastructure team has already accomplished great things, there are still numerous exciting engineering challenges ahead that we can tackle together.

I'm looking forward to committing myself to this new challenge ðŸ˜€
