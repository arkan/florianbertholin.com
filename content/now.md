I'm currently living in **Annecy, France**, where I'm working remotely as Head of Engineering at Livestorm since **January 2021**.

## Professional Focus

- Software Development: My team and I are deep into the breaking of a Ruby On Rails monolith into a fleet of microservices written in Go.

## Personal Projects

- Expanding the family: We are expecting a baby girl in September 2024. ðŸ¥°
- Reading: I've always had difficulties reading because of my **TDAH**, but I'm now forcing myself to read a little bit every day for at least 30 minutes. I aim to read one book per month. This practice is gradually becoming a rewarding part of my routine.
