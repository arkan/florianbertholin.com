Looking back, there were various factors that contributed to my burnout.\nHowever, I take full responsibility for ignoring the warning signs that my body was sending me. I dismissed symptoms such as pins and needles, tachycardia, and dizziness, telling myself that they were not serious. I pushed myself to keep going like this for several months until I had a scare that made me seek medical attention. My doctor put me on strong sedatives and recommended a lengthy recovery period.\nAs time passed, I realized that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see myself returning to Heetch. Therefore, during the summer of 2020, I decided to end my six-year journey with the company. As they say, all good things must come to an end! ðŸ¤ž\nWhat did I learn from this experience? Burnout is terrible, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t wish it on anyone. However, it was a wake-up call that helped me realize that I\u0026rsquo;m not invincible and that I need to listen to my body and be kind to it.\nI also discovered that I\u0026rsquo;ve been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) since my teenage years.\nFinally, I understood that being different is okay and not something to be ashamed of. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to have worked with amazing people at Heetch over the years. I learned so much about myself, human relationships, and technical skills.\nAs for what\u0026rsquo;s next, I\u0026rsquo;m still figuring things out. I need more time to recover fully, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably look for a not-too-stressful role. I feel that I\u0026rsquo;m still vulnerable and need to take things slow.\n","date":"31 August 2020","permalink":"/posts/burnout-and-im-leaving-heetch/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Burnout and I'm leaving Heetch"},{"content":"After several years in Switzerland, during which I worked on enhancing email security with Revamail, I have decided that it is time for me to move on to something else.\nI am excited to announce that I will be joining Heetch as their first Go engineer.\nHeetch is a ride-hailing service that operates in several European cities, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to being a part of their team.\nMy task at Heetch will be to help migrate a Ruby on Rails monolith to a fleet of microservices in Go.\nThis will be a challenging but exciting project that will allow me to apply my skills and experience in a new context.
